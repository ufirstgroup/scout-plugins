Overview
------------

Reports Redis metrics extracted from Redis' `info` command:

 * Uptime
 * Role
 * Memory Used
 * Connections per Second
 * Commands per Second
 * Connected Clients
 * Connected Slaves
 * Changes Since Last Save
 * Hits per Second
 * Misses per Second
 * Hits Ratio: Hits / (Hits + Misses)

Also reports "up" (1=yes, 0=no), and alerts when up == 0.

Dependencies
------------

Requires the ruby Redis client library ('redis' gem).
